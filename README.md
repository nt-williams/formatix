# formatix

> The personal computing toolbox of Nick Williams

`formatix` is a general R computing toolbox. Included functions provide
support for text formatting problems (with a focus on statistical
reports), an interpretation generator, and lazy deconstructing and
global environment assignment of data frame and list objects. `formatix`
is updated frequently as new problems are encountered that do not have
existing solutions.

## Installation

You can install formatix from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nt-williams/formatix")
```

## Contributing
